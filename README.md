# Music Releases

This weeks project was to get started with react components by building a page containing recent music releases. The data was provided to us in a file, containing a download of an API-response from Spotify. 

## The problem

We started out by logging all the data in the console. Then when we had the data we started out by creating React components- empty at first and then added data into them using props. We used the array function map when iterating the array data. 

We chose to display the albums/singles in a CSS-grid. It really made it easy making the page responsive. 

We completed one level at the time and ended up doing 2 of 3 black requirements. 

In the end of the project we ran the linter and got a lot of warnings and spent some time to fix them. 

If we had more time maybe we could have styled the page some more, like aligning the page header better and add a favicon. But we chose to focus on the React-part.
